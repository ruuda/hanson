# This file defines a Nix environment in which all required build tools and
# dependencies are available. You do not *need* to use it, you can install
# dependencies in any way you see fit. The advantage of the Nix environment is
# that the Nixpkgs revision is pinned, and thereby the versions of all tools. If
# you can build a commit today, you should be able to build it three years from
# now. The same may not be true if you use the distro-provided versions. You can
# start a shell with dependencies available by running `nix run` in the root of
# the repository.
